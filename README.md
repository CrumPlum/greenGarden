# GreenGarden

Hi! I’m Alex [CrumPlum](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHts1E2GLIjuNWEBcON_wpA). You came across my notes, many call them - green garden. They’re kind of strange, so some context might help.  

These notes are mostly written for myself: they’re roughly my thinking environment. But I’m sharing them publicly as an experiment. If a note seems confusing or under-explained, it’s probably because I didn’t write it for you! Sorry—that’s sort of an essential tension of this experiment. My system is based on the Zettelkasten system with modifications by other members as well as my own.  

I'm from Ukraine, so I take notes in Ukrainian, but even if you don't know the language, there is a translator and the meaning of the notes and tips can be understood in any language.  
Start from the HOME page, here is the [CrumPlum's green garden](https://crumplum.github.io/greenGardenCrumPlum/)  

PS: Now this is my own initiative, but if I develop it and I need to live - this is where Patreon will appear  

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my own use, and [Github](https://github.com/) and Quartz for posting to the Internet  

If you want to write to me - my tg - @CrumPlum
